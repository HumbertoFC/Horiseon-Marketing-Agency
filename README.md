# Horiseon-Marketing-Agency

A client,marketing agency,requested that their codebase follows accessibility standards
SO THAT their site is optimized for search engines

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title




I used semantic html elements to make this website more accessible.
By doing this it becomes more organized and easier to navigate & understand,
I also fixed one anchor that wasnt working correctly. 

## The Horiseon marketing agency website looks like this:

## And it should remain with the same look at the end with full functionality.
Horiseon Marketing Agency, thank you for your trust!
